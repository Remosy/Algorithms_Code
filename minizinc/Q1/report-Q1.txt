(b) When I use Gecode (Bundled), time are similar to results(above table) got from FD-12
(c) I could not solve 21-8, my result was code like:ï»¿
	array[trucks, customers, goods] of var int: result; 
	I thought it might make too many row, after I change the position, I can run the 21-8.
	Since those files can be run within 1 minitues, thus, there is no further improvement.
